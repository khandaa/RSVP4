# Prompts for 2025-09-13

- separate the package dependencies for dev and prod deployments for base, backend and frontend. Use webpack for prod deployment of frontend.
- start the backend on port 5001 and wire the frontend to listen on port 5001
- start the frontend on port 3001
- use webpack to create frontend build
- enhance ecosystem.config.js to add deployments for rsvp application in the file
- I have 2 ecosystem.config.js to run 2 different apps on the same server. How do i change the file so that it runs and maintains both of them
