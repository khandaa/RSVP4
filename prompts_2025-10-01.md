- dropdown in event types is coming twice in create event page.

Resolution (2025-10-01):
- Deduplicated Event Type options in Create Event by normalizing by name (case-insensitive) and sorting in `frontend/src/components/events/EventCreate.js`. This removes repeated labels like "Conference", "Corporate Party", "Product Launch", "Wedding", etc.
