# RSVP4 Application UI Testing Issues

*Test executed on: 2025-07-31T10:02:14+05:30*

## Executive Summary

UI testing of the RSVP4 application revealed several critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure proper functionality and user experience. The testing was conducted using Puppeteer to automate browser interactions, simulating user behavior across all major application features including authentication, event management, guest management, and RSVP tracking.

**Total Issues Found: 20**
- High Severity: 13
- Medium Severity: 6
- Low Severity: 1

## 1. Authentication Issues

### High: Authentication API Failures
- **Description**: Multiple 401 (Unauthorized) errors occur during API calls, indicating JWT token authentication issues
- **Impact**: Users may be unable to perform authenticated operations
- **Possible Fix**: Review JWT token handling and ensure proper token refresh mechanisms are in place

## 2. API Endpoint Issues

### High: 404 (Not Found) API Errors
- **Description**: Multiple API endpoints are returning 404 errors
- **Impact**: Critical functionality failing across multiple sections
- **Possible Fix**: Verify all API routes are correctly defined and accessible, check for path mismatches between frontend and backend

### High: SubEvents API Errors
- **Description**: Error fetching all subevents with undefined error details
- **Impact**: Unable to display or manage subevents
- **Possible Fix**: Debug the subevent API endpoint and response handling

## 3. Navigation Issues

### High: Broken Navigation to Key Sections
- **Description**: Unable to navigate to guests and RSVP sections
- **Impact**: Core functionality is inaccessible to users
- **Possible Fix**: Check route definitions in App.js and sidebar component

## 4. Component Issues

### Medium: Missing Event Management UI Elements
- **Description**: Add/Create Event buttons not found, Edit buttons missing, no clickable events
- **Impact**: Users cannot create or manage events
- **Possible Fix**: Review Event component implementation and ensure proper rendering of action buttons

### Medium: Missing SubEvent Management UI Elements
- **Description**: Add SubEvent button not found
- **Impact**: Users cannot create or manage subevents
- **Possible Fix**: Check SubEvent component implementation

### Medium: Missing Guest Management UI Elements
- **Description**: Add Guest button not found
- **Impact**: Users cannot add or manage guests
- **Possible Fix**: Check Guest component implementation

### Medium: RSVP Management Section Missing
- **Description**: RSVP management section not found in the application
- **Impact**: Users cannot manage RSVPs
- **Possible Fix**: Verify RSVP component is correctly implemented and routed

### Low: Settings Form Issues
- **Description**: Save button not found in settings
- **Impact**: Users cannot save settings changes
- **Possible Fix**: Review Settings component implementation

## 5. React Component Warnings

### High: Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Switch
- **Description**: A component is changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled in FileUploadConfig
- **Impact**: Form may behave unpredictably, potentially causing data loss
- **Possible Fix**: Ensure the input value is properly initialized and consistently managed (never switches between defined/undefined)

## Detailed Issue Logs

### API Errors (High Severity)

1. Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found) - Multiple occurrences
2. Failed to load resource: 401 (Unauthorized) - Multiple occurrences 
3. Login error - Authentication failure
4. Error fetching all subevents - Multiple occurrences

### Navigation Errors (High Severity)

1. Could not navigate to guests section
2. Could not navigate to rsvp section

### UI Element Issues (Medium Severity)

1. Events: Add/Create Event button not found
2. Events: No Edit buttons found for events
3. Events: No clickable events found to view details
4. SubEvents: Add SubEvent button not found
5. Guests: Add Guest button not found
6. RSVP: RSVP management section not found

### Form Issues (Low Severity)

1. Settings: Save button not found in settings

## Recommendations

1. **Authentication Flow**: Review and fix the authentication mechanism, particularly JWT token handling
2. **API Endpoint Verification**: Check all API endpoints against the backend implementation
3. **Route Configuration**: Ensure all routes are correctly defined in App.js
4. **Component Rendering**: Verify all UI components render expected buttons and interactive elements
5. **Form Handling**: Fix controlled/uncontrolled component issues in forms
6. **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling with user-friendly messages

## Next Steps

1. Address high-severity issues first, particularly the API and authentication errors
2. Fix navigation issues to ensure all sections are accessible
3. Resolve UI element issues to enable full application functionality
4. Implement comprehensive error handling
5. Re-test the application after fixes are applied
