# Prompts for 2025-09-13

- separate the package dependencies for dev and prod deployments for base, backend and frontend. Use webpack for prod deployment of frontend.
- start the backend on port 5001 and wire the frontend to listen on port 5001
- start the frontend on port 3001
- use webpack to create frontend build
- enhance ecosystem.config.js to add deployments for rsvp application in the file
- I have 2 ecosystem.config.js to run 2 different apps on the same server. How do i change the file so that it runs and maintains both of them
- create nginx conf file that expects frontend files in frontend/build folder and backend to run on port 5001
- write a script to test the deployment of both frontend and backend separately.

- customer should have permissions to create clients, events, rsvp, employees, teams
- fix manage employees error

Jahanvi & Rohin 
25 dec to 29 dec 
Bride sheet
groom sheet
shalini sheet

Rohin Dad list
Rohin Mom list - should not be on same floor 


- dropdown in event types is coming twice in create event page.

Resolution (2025-10-01):
- Deduplicated Event Type options in Create Event by normalizing by name (case-insensitive) and sorting in `frontend/src/components/events/EventCreate.js`. This removes repeated labels like "Conference", "Corporate Party", "Product Launch", "Wedding", etc.

- fix errors in creating a guest and guest group
- when adding a new client, the city, phone and email are not visible on the list page . please check if these are not getting stored in the database
- create a list of tasks for the following implementation. Update prompts_tasks.md with this list Add ability to upload documents for guests 
- Create a single page for managing all guest activities. It should be in tabular format and should have fields to add guests, have their RSVP statuses, invite them to various events and sub-events, manage their travel details, room allocation , no of guests coming with them, their preferences if any, This table should also have comments field where the customer should be able to add comments. The table should have fields that are linked to various actions like send invites, update guest details, update rsvp etc

- fix errors of guest activities Uncaught runtime errors:

### Backend (Express.js & SQLite)

1. **refer to guest tables**
understand these tables and then implement the below functionality
rsvp_master_guests
rsvp_guest_documents
rsvp_guest_details
rsvp_guest_event_allocation
rsvp_guest_group_details
rsvp_guest_travel

2. **API Endpoints (`/api/guests`)**

	* **File Upload**
		+ Create a `POST /api/guests/:id/documents` endpoint to handle document uploads for a specific guest
	* **Guest Data Management**
		+ Enhance the `GET /api/guests` endpoint to return the new fields
		+ Enhance the `PUT /api/guests/:id` endpoint to allow updating all the new fields, including travel, accommodation, and preferences
	* **RSVP Management**
		+ Create a `POST /api/guests/:id/rsvp` endpoint to update the main RSVP status
		+ Create a `POST /api/guests/:id/sub-events/:sub_event_id/rsvp` endpoint to manage RSVP for sub-events
	* **Invitations**
		+ Create a `POST /api/guests/send-invites` endpoint that can send invitations in bulk (this might integrate with an email service)

### Frontend (React)

1. **New Component: `GuestActivities.js`**
	* Create a new page/component to serve as the central hub for guest management
	* Use a table library (like Material-UI's `DataGrid` or `react-table`) to display guest information
	* **Table Columns**
		+ Guest Name
		+ RSVP Status (with a dropdown/button to change it)
		+ Events/Sub-events invited to (with RSVP status for each)
		+ Travel Details (perhaps a modal popup to view/edit)
		+ Room Allocation
		+ No. of Accompanying Guests
		+ Preferences
		+ Documents (with a button to upload/view)
		+ Comments (editable field or modal)
		+ Actions (buttons for "Send Invite", "Update Details", "Delete Guest")

2. **Component Functionality**
	* **Data Fetching:** Fetch all guest data on component mount
	* **State Management:** Use React state to manage guest data, table sorting, and filtering
	* **Actions**
		+ Implement functions to handle API calls for updating RSVP, guest details, etc.
		+ Create a modal for uploading documents
		+ Create a modal for viewing/editing travel, accommodation, and other detailed information

3. **Routing and Sidebar**
	* Add a new route for the `GuestActivities` page in `App.js`
	* Add a link to the new page in the appropriate sidebar configuration file (e.g., `AdminSidebar.js`)

- [ ] **Implement document upload for guests**
  - [ ] Add the ability to upload documents for each guest.
  - [ ] Create a new database table to store document metadata.
  - [ ] Develop a UI to display all attachments for a guest.
